# YouTube Educational Content Quality Analyzer 📊📚

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and ranks educational YouTube videos using a **custom Educational Quality Score (EQS)**.  
Instead of focusing only on views or likes, the system combines multiple signals to identify **high-quality learning content**.

The goal is to help students make **better learning decisions** by highlighting videos that provide real educational value.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Students often struggle to choose quality educational videos on YouTube due to:
- Misleading view counts
- Clickbait content
- Lack of quality indicators

This project addresses the problem by creating a **data-driven ranking system**.

---

## 🚀 Solution Approach
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Engineer meaningful engagement metrics
3. Design a custom quality score (EQS)
4. Rank videos and categorize them into quality tiers
5. Visualize insights for better interpretation

---

## 🧮 Educational Quality Score (EQS)
The **EQS** is a weighted score based on:

- Engagement (likes, comments, views)
- Comment sentiment score
- Video duration
- Channel subscriber count

This ensures that quality is measured beyond popularity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Correlation analysis
- Sentiment-based evaluation
- Video ranking system
- Quality categorization (High / Medium / Low)

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains information such as:
- Video title
- Views, likes, comments
- Comment sentiment score
- Video duration
- Channel subscribers

*(Synthetic dataset created for learning and analysis purposes)*

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- High views do not always indicate high educational quality
- Videos with positive sentiment and balanced duration score higher
- Ranking provides more value than simple classification

---

## 📌 Use Case
- Students selecting educational content
- EdTech content evaluation
- Data-driven content ranking systems


## 📌 Key Insight
Videos with moderate duration and positive comment sentiment often ranked higher than videos with very high views but low engagement quality.
